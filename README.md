# DBScardfetcherbot

EDIT (2025): Bot is now defunct due to Reddit API changes. Served the DBSCG community during a period of 10,000+ subscribers and the height of the game's popularity.

Hello, my name is Matias I am a 17 year old from florida that has had way too much time on their hands, because of this, I took it upon myself to work with the guy from DBSDecks to create a card fetcher bot for the DBScardgame subreddit. The bot is currently in beta right now, so there are still some bugs and some holes in the card database but its bones are strong enough where its worth trying on a slightly larger scale than just me and my other reddit account. Anyhow, here are the basics for the bot:

In the comments of any post in DBScardgame (for now, more subreddits coming soon), you can type in the card you want fetched by typing it in between two curly bois {}, The bot will then respond to your comment with a link to the card. (e.x "My favorite card is {Scientist Fu}" the bot will then respond with "|Scientist Fu|" )

You can type in as many cards as you want in your post (e.x "My favorite cards are {Scientist Fu} and {Scrambling Assault Son Goten}" and the bot will respond appropriately in the same comment.)

The bot also supports half written card names if you don't remember full card names, however the less specific you get the more clouded the results the bot provides will be (e.x You can comment "I dont remember the full name but its kinda like {Scientist}" and the bot will still reply with "|Scientist Fu|", however if you just type in "{fu}" there are a lot of possibilities as to what the bot could pick, so it might be not exactly what you are thinking of)

The bot is not case sensitive (e.x "{ScIenTIST fU}" and "{scientist fu}" return the same results, don't worry about proper capitalization), the same applies for special characters, you dont have to worry about special characters, use them if you want or dont use them if you dont.

The bot currently does not support common nicknames, however if there are any you think should be implemented, please let me know :)
