If you wanna make some derivative of this, step 1 is gonna be to install reddits API called PRAW, you can download this
from the console using the console command

pip install praw==3.6.0

Once you do that, make sure to your client API keys from reddit, you can see where they should go because I replaced
instances of mine with 'put your stuff here' in main.py, alongside this, make the account for your bot.

This bot can be super easily repurposed for any card game, as long as the databases match up with your respective card game's cards
and especially your chosen card game website's card storage systems, in this case, cards were organized 1-2265, as you can see in
the cardDB and cardDBNS files which store the original and special characterless card databases respectively. I reccomend fetching this
data using a webscraper, I personally used Selenium for Python 3, and make sure to make appropriate changes to the regex if your
cards are stored using alpha values as opposed to numeric ones, as the regex right now only keeps numbers while extracting card codes.
